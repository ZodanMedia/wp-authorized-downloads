Protect documents from unauthorized download.

== Description ==
This plugin allows site admins to protect specific attachment file types (e.g. Pdf, Doc(x)) from direct access. Instead, the files are served through WordPress, allowing you to check if a user is logged in or has the required permissions before granting access.

**Features:**
* Adds a checkbox to media attachments to mark them as "Authorized only".
* Creates an internal page and rewrite rules to intercept requests to protected file types.
* Checks user login status (or other custom logic you add) before serving files.
* Provides a settings page to specify which file types should be protected.


== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/z-authorized-downloads/` or install via the Plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen.
3. Go to **Settings â†’ Authorized Downloads** to set which file types should be protected and which roles can download protected files
4. Mark attachments as "Authorized only" in the Media Library to restrict access.
5. Optionally, override the default permitted roles per attachment in the Media Library.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I customize the authorization logic? =
Yes. The plugin checks if the user is logged in by default, but you can extend `handle_protected_request()` to add role checks or other conditions.

= What happens to unprotected files? =
Files that are not marked as "Authorized only" will still be directly accessible by URL.

= Do I need to manually edit .htaccess? =
No. The plugin will manage the `.htaccess` rules for you when you save settings.

= Do you have plans to improve the plugin? =
We currently have on our roadmap:
* Adding information to the media overview screen.
* Make the plugin pluggable.
* Adding a custom capability to manage which users can edit settings (both general and per file).
* Adding more translations.

If you have a feature suggestion, send us an email at [plugins@zodan.nl](plugins@zodan.nl).
